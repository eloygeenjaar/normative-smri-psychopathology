The GitHub repository that accompanies the paper: Neurodevelopmental trajectories in children with internalizing, externalizing and emotion dysregulation symptoms,

## Running the code
Some simulated data can be downloaded on: [My OneDrive](https://gtvault-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/egeenjaar3_gatech_edu/EUiEZcb4BHJJiLYEYY1bj1gBczGDP07b1B_gxkX-7M5T5g?e=hidfcu)

The files in the zip file should be unzipped in a folder called 'data', this data folder should be in the same directory as the Python scripts. Then you can run the model on the simulated data as follows:
```
python main.py -df data/sim_data.csv -tr data/trainset.csv -te data/testset.csv -ep 1
```
